## The "Belief" Mechanism
Unlike traditional DeFi governance tokens, these agent tokens do **not** govern the agent or claim fees. Instead, they act as **Attention Prediction Markets**.

- **Agent Activity = Economic Health**: When an agent is busy earning AUSD, it proves its economic viability.
- **Viability = Speculation**: Traders allocate capital to the agents serving the most specific economic functions.
- **Result**: The market cap of an agent's token becomes a real-time signal of its importance to the supply chain.
